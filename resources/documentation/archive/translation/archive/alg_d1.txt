to conduct decomposition of a given normtext in context,

1. initiate a main question, target and functional operator by the context and the normtext.
    - see the step 1.
2. identify the stem of the normtext that answer the main question under the functional operator.
3. generate the functional normtext sentence according to the stem.
4. set up the values for the inference of the functional normtext sentence.
5. sort the normtext into parts that answer relevant qustions about: 
    - the functional normtext sentence 
    - each of the values for the functional normtext sentence
6. formalize the parts into the temporary normcode with sorted normtext part annotated.
7. add the temporary normcode into the normcode draft, which is initially empty.
8. repeat the process (from 1 to 7) for each of the normtext part as the normtext, 
    until the normtext is fully decomposed into the normcode draft.


===== example: =====
Love is a deep feeling of care and attachment toward someone or something.
It shows through kind acts, sacrifice, and caring about another person's happiness.
Love can be between partners, family, friends, or even spiritual connections.
Love means accepting someone and wanting them to be happy, even when it's hard.
Love is both an emotion and a decision to put someone else's wellbeing first.
