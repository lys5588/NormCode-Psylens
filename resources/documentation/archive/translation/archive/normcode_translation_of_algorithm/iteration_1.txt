    ?: how to conduct decomposition of a given normtext in context?
    <= @by(:_:)
        /: It is done by some method.
    <- :_:{8 steps procedure}({normtext}; {context})
        /: The method follows the 8 steps procedure on normtext and context.
    <- {normtext}
        ...: a given normtext
    <- {context}
        ...: in context
    <- {8 steps procedure}
        ...: 1. initiate a main question, target and functional operator by the context and the normtext. - by step 1 algorithm.
        ...: 2. identify the stem of the normtext that answer the main question under the functional operator.
        ...: 3. generate the functional normtext sentence according to the stem.
        ...: 4. set up the values for the inference of the functional normtext sentence.
        ...: 5. sort the normtext into parts that answer relevant qustions about: the functional normtext sentence and each of the values for the functional normtext sentence
        ...: 6. staging the parts into the temporary normcode draft with sorted normtext part annotated.
        ...: 7. add the temporary normcode into the normcode draft, which is initially empty.
        ...: 8. repeat the process (from 1 to 7) for each of the normtext part as the normtext, until the normtext is fully decomposed into the normcode draft.
