TARGET EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- Extract the main entity, process, condition, or concept that the text is asking about
- The target can be any type: imperative (::(action)), judgement (<condition>), object ({{entity}}), etc.
- Examples: "What is baking?" → target: "::(bake)" (imperative), "When is Kelly beautiful?" → target: "<kelly is beautiful>" (judgement), "What is a user account?" → target: "{{user_account}}" (object)
- Use descriptive but concise names that capture the essence of what's being asked
- Avoid generic terms like "it" or "this" - be specific about what the text is actually describing
