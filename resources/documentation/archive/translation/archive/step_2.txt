to conduct decomposition of a given normtext,

1. identify the part of the normtext that answer the main question.
2. generate the functional normtext sentence that answer the main question.
3. set up the values for the inference of the functional normtext sentence.
4. sort the remaining normtext into parts that answer relevant qustions about: 
    - the functional normtext sentence 
    - each of the values in the functional normtext sentence
5. combine the parts into the temporary normcode.
