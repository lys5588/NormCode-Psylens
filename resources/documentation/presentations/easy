# What’s the core idea?

Big AIs (“foundation models”) are great at giving a *reasonable* answer, fast. But they often give the **average** answer for a task, not the **exact** answer you need in your real situation. That creates a gap between what you ask for and what you actually get.

# Why does that gap happen?

* These models learn patterns from huge piles of data.
* When you ask a question, they tend to return what’s *most typical* in that data.
* Real life is messy and specific—your goals, rules, tools, and context might not match the “typical” case.

# Two ways to close the gap

1. **Full simulation (not practical yet).**
   In theory, we could build one giant system that models the whole world *and* you, so the AI always acts with real feedback. That’s incredibly complex and out of reach for most problems today.

2. **Shared middle ground (what works now).**
   Instead of changing the AI itself, we build a **shared workspace** around it where humans and the AI can collaborate with clear rules:

   * Connect the AI to the right **documents and data** (so it can look things up instead of guessing).
   * Give it **tools** (like calculators, databases, calendars, code runners) so it can *do* things, not just talk.
   * Define **goals, constraints, and success checks** in plain terms so it knows what “good” looks like.
   * Add **feedback loops** (reviews, tests, small pilots) so it learns what works in your setting.

# What this looks like in practice

* **Richer context:** “Use the project brief in this folder and last quarter’s numbers.”
* **Clear rules:** “Never email a client before a human approves the draft.”
* **Right tools:** “You can query our CRM and run the pricing calculator.”
* **Built-in checks:** “Run unit tests before shipping code; flag anything over budget.”

# A quick example

You ask an AI to recommend stocks for your portfolio.

* **Average answer:** suggests popular tech stocks without considering your risk tolerance or financial goals.
* **Shared workspace answer:** reads your investment profile, checks your current holdings, analyzes your risk tolerance, and recommends a diversified portfolio that fits your timeline and constraints—then asks you to review before placing any trades.

# A note on “alignment”

Sometimes an AI seems polite and helpful (**weak alignment**) but still misses your deeper values or edge cases (**strong alignment**). The shared workspace approach helps here too—values become **visible rules and checks** (e.g., privacy rules, fairness checks, accessibility standards) that the AI must follow.

# Why not just prompt better?

Good prompts help, but they can’t replace **access to the right info, tools, and guardrails**. Think of prompts like giving directions; the shared workspace is the **map, car, and seatbelt**.

# Bottom line

Don’t expect the model alone to solve your real-world problem.
**Wrap it in a simple, well-designed workspace**—with your data, tools, goals, and checks—so the AI becomes a reliable teammate instead of a clever guesser.
