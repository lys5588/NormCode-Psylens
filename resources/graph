**Hero Visual — Code ↔ Graph split:**
Below the CTAs, a side-by-side showing the core idea at a glance:
- **Left:** A compact NormCode snippet (5 lines) in an editor frame
- **Center:** → arrow
- **Right:** Abstract graph/tree representation of the same snippet (SVG nodes + edges)
- **Labels:** "You write this" / "It becomes this"

> **DONE:** Created an inline SVG graph in `website_temp/index.html` hero section,
> matching the Canvas app's visual style — hexagonal function nodes (purple),
> rounded-rect value nodes (blue), smooth-step edges, status dots, ground/output
> indicators, and imperative badges. Based on a 5-line NormCode snippet.
